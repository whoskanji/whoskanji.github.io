		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		<h3>"What Snapchat version should I use with Shadow X?"</h3>
		<p><i>Shadow X was built for 11.80, but if you update past it (as on 5/11/22) Shadow X may experience some issues.</i></p>
		<h3>"I have installed Shadow, but I do not see it within Snapchat. What's wrong?"</h3>
		<p><i>After installing Shadow and you look in Snapchat and you don't see "Shadow" at the top of your chats/stories view, install Choicy and *only* enable the "shadow" bundle and try again.</i></p>
		<h3>"Some features are greyed out in Shadow X's settings. What's going on?"</h3>
		<p><i>If you are in Shadow X's settings and you happen to try to turn on a settings and it won't because it's greyed out, that means that we have disabled that feature server side. This could mean that the feature is broken and we have to patch it, but we don't want you to be left with a broken feature. Once we have the issue fixed, we will push an update on my repo and enable the feature again.</i></p>
		<h3>"How can I donate to development?" - <i>Yes, this is a common question.</i></h3>
		<p><i>Donations are <b>NOT</b> necessary, but if you would like to donate, you can do so at my <a href="https://paypal.me/kanjithegod">PayPal</a>.</i></p>
		<h3>"Where can I receive extra support if my issue is not solved from this documentation?"</h3>
		<p>I have a Discord Server where <a href="https://twitter.com/no5up_">Wyatt</a> and myself are pretty active and can provide as much support as we can. You can join the Discord Server <a href="https://discord.gg/kanji">here</a>.</p>
